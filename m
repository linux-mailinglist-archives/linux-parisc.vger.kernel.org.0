It was hard to understand how the patch could cause a kernel crash. The only significant change
is adding the purge_kernel_dcache_page_addr call in flush_anon_page.Â  It uses the pdc instruction
to invalidate the kernel mapping.Â  Assuming pdc is actually implemented as described in the architecture
book, it doesn't write back to memory at priority 0.Â  It just invalidates the addressed cache line.

My 6.8.9 build is still going after 2 hours and 42 minutes...

That's a good find.

libxs-parse-keyword-perl just built a couple of hours ago on sap rp4440.Â  At last email, it was running 6.1.
