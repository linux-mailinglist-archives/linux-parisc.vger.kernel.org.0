Good point, at least as long as the slab allocators don't call kfree_rcu()
while holding any of the slab locks.

However, that would require a separate list for the kfree_rcu() callbacks,
and concurrent access to those lists of kfree_rcu() callbacks.  So this
might work, but would add some complexity and also yet another restriction
between RCU and another kernel subsystem.  So I would like to try the
other approaches first, for example, the time-based approach in my
prototype and Eric Dumazet's more polished patch.

But the immediate-invocation possibility is still there if needed.

Agreed.  Especially given that there are a number of things that can
be done within RCU.

And same for call_rcu().

And this is not the first time we have run into this.  The last time
was about 15 years ago, if I remember correctly, and that one led to
some of the quiescent-state forcing and callback-invocation batch size
tricks still in use today.  My only real surprise is that it took so
long for this to come up again.  ;-)

Please note also that in the common case on default configurations,
callback invocation is done on the CPU that posted the callback.
This means that callback invocation normally applies backpressure
to the callback-happy workload.

So why then is there a problem?

The problem is not the lack of backpressure, but rather that the
scheduling of callback invocation needs to be a bit more considerate
of the needs of the rest of the system.  In the common case, that is.
Except that the uncommon case is real-time configurations, in which care
is needed anyway.  But I am in the midst of helping those out as well,
details on the "dev" branch of -rcu.
