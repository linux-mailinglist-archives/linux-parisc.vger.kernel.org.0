Yes.

Sadly, reverting this change (23243c1ace9fb4eae2f75e0fe0ece8e3219fb4f3) do=
es not
restore the original behavior.

Yes.
See above, but it worked when I had SUBARCH=3Dx86 (when running my laptop)=
.

Please note, that we don't have a 64-bit parisc userspace yet (just kernel=
).
This means, that all builds on parisc machines are 32bit and do a
cross-compilation to a parisc64 kernel if requested in the .config.

Right. That is the old behaviour. Based on the CONFIG_64BIT option
the hppa64 compiler is choosen for CROSS_COMPILE.

s.

Yes, probably.

as mentioned above: Doesn't solve the issue.

Might be an option, but it's not as handy as simply choosing CONFIG_64BIT
and then things are done automatically.

Tried it, but doesn't work.
asm-offsets.c is still preprocessed with 32bit compiler (gcc, not hppa20-g=
cc).

Thanks for your help so far!
If you like I'm happy to give you an account on a hppa64 machine to reprod=
uce yourself.
I'll now try to bisect where it goes wrong. There must be something else b=
efore commit 23243c1ace9fb4eae2f75e0fe0ece8e3219fb4f3.
