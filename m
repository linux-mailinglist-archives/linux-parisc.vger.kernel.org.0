If we ditched the Coldfire profiling clock, it would be possible to 
dedicate one hardware timer to the clocksource device and the other to the 
(oneshot) clockevent device.

That's a win if it means that the clocksource can use the full counter 
width (making timer interrupts less frequent and timer interrupt latency 
less problematic) and run at higher frequency (making the clocksource more 
precise).

Also, note that hrtimers won't work with a periodic clockevent device (as 
in Arnd's RFC patch). If you want hrtimers, I think you'll need both 
hardware timers or else re-implement the existing synthetic clocksource 
using the same oneshot timer driving a new oneshot clockevent device.

Please note that the lack of a spare hardware timer is a separate issue to 
the failure of mcftmr_read_clk() and m68328_read_clk() to check the timer 
reload interrupt flag (which may make those clocksources needlessly 
susceptible to issues caused by timer interrupt latency...).
