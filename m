I checked the machines that I have and they all have coherent caches and TLBs.  I think
flush and sync are required on all machines with write-back caches.  This makes write
visible to I/O adapter (memory).  The c3600 has a write-back data cache.  See "PDC Procedures"
page 4-21.

This might be affected by the TLB U bit.  Possibly, the U bit is not set for pages in the
I/O address region (IO-PDIR) and we need flush/sync as a result.
