Using 'an' in both of these cases is correct, even though 'mcount'
starts with a consonant, since it's pronounced as-if it were 'emcount'.
I will leave this as-is.

This was the specific wording requested by Steve, and it's trying to
describe the instructions at rec->ip, rather than the value of rec->ip,
so I think it's better to leave this as-is.

I agree that would be a good thing, but as Steve suggests I will leave
this for subsequent rework, as I think that also implies more
rework/renaming in the core code (e.g. to more cleanly separate the
notion of a callsite from mcount specifically).

Steve, if you'd like help with that (or review), I'd be happy to help.

Thanks,
Mark.
