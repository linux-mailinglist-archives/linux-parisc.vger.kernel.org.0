I wonder whether we can improve support for your proposed configuration 
i.e. a system with no oneshot clockevent device.

The 16 platforms you identified are not all in that category but I suspect 
that there are others which are (though they don't appear in this series 
because they already use GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS).

One useful optimization would be some way to elide oneshot clockevent 
support (perhaps with the help of Link Time Optimization).

I think that is a good reason to convert all m68k platforms at once and to 
elide some of the dead code.

On the subject of register accesses, via1[ACR] is shared with ADB drivers, 
so this patch probably has to protect those accesses with 
local_irq_save/restore or local_irq_disable/enable. (I can't be sure of 
the contexts in which .set_state_shutdown and .set_state_periodic methods 
are called.)

Right, and many emulators trade-off timing accuracy for performance which 
makes them unsuitable for testing invasive changes of that sort.

After looking at the chip documentation I don't think it's viable to use 
the hardware timers in the way I proposed. A VIA register access requires 
at least one full VIA clock cycle (about 1.3 us) which means register 
accesses themselves cause timing delays. They also make clocksource reads 
expensive.

I think this rules out oneshot clockevent devices because if the system 
offered such a device it would preferentially get used as a tick device.

So I think your approach (periodic clockevent device driven by the 
existing periodic tick interrupt) is best for this platform due to 
simplicity (not much code) and performance (good accuracy, no additional 
overhead).

I suspect the same approach would work equally well on other platforms too 
(even though they are probably be capable of oneshot clockevent devices).
