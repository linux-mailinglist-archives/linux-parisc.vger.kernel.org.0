Or the function could simply return the number of callbacks queued
on the current CPU, and let the caller decide how many is too many.

OK, then I suggest having the interface return you the number of
callbacks.  That allows you to experiment with the cutoff.

Give or take the ioctl overhead...

Is it possible to measure it easily?
