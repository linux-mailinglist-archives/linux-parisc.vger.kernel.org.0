Hi.

 Just a few months ago I hacked your operating system and I have full contr=
ol of your device.

I implanted a small application into your device which sends me your curren=
t IP address and allows me to connect to your device just like a remote des=
ktop. Even if you change your password, it won=E2=80=99t help.

How I infected you?
The router that you used to connect to the Internet had a security hole. Yo=
u can read about this problem by searching for CVA-2020-105. I hacked your =
router and I put my code into it, and when you tried to connect to the Inte=
rnet, my program infected your device. =20
=20
A little while later, when I was searching your web browsing history I was =
shocked by what I saw!!

The sites for adults you visited ... you know what I mean...I just want to =
say - your fantasies are shifted far away from the normal course!...

For months now, I have been spying on you through your device .. especially=
 when you visited those sites to have fun... Those videos show clearly you =
having fun ... this is pretty nasty and I would be very worried if I were y=
ou.

I have secured 2 videos:
[[-Email-]]_1447084044.mp4 (119.2 MB)
[[-Email-]]_1444285697.mp4 (64.1 MB)

You can verify that the timestamps correspond to the moments you were enjoy=
ing yourself...(considering your perversions)  I will give you a chance to =
conclude if you want me to forget about the whole case, remove the files an=
d disable the nasty app that is spying on you.

I am waiting to hear your opinion within 24 hours. Yes, I give you 24 hours=
  only to respond by Contacting me on this email address: tdm.todd@yandex.c=
om

If you fail to respond within 24  hours, I promise you - I will send  those=
 files with you enjoying yourself to all your contact lists, associates and=
 social network friends.

With access to your device, I will know when you read this message. When yo=
u open it the time will start ticking. You have 24 hours only!

Nobody will help you if you report this email.. Before they find me your li=
fe will be ruined! If you do not cooperate with me - I will release this ug=
ly material immediately.

This is why I advise you to write so that we can deliberate and forget abou=
t the whole situation between us.

Be angry at your fantasies ...

Remember, time is ticking  =20
