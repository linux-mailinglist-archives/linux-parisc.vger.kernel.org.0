That's my understanding too, with a couple of details:

1) After the copy we perform and complete all the data + instruction cache
   maintenance *before* marking the mapping as executable.

2) Even *after* the mapping is marked executable, a thread could take a
   spurious fault on an instruction fetch for the new instructions. One way to
   think about this is that the CPU attempted to speculate the instructions
   earlier, saw that the mapping was faulting, and placed a "generate a fault
   here" operation into its pipeline to generate that later.

   The CPU pipeline/OoO-engine/whatever is effectively a transient cache for
   operations in-flight which is only ever "invalidated" by a
   context-synchronization-event (akin to an x86 serializing effect).

   We're only guarnateed to have a new instruction fetch (from the I-cache into
   the CPU pipeline) after the next context synchronization event (akin to an x86
   serializing effect), and luckily out exception entry/exit is architecturally
   guarnateed to provide that (unless we explicitly opt out via a control bit).

I know we're a bit lax with that today: I think we omit the
context-synchronization-event when enabling ftrace callsites, and worse, for
static keys. Those are both on my TODO list of nasty problems that require
careful auditing...

I suspect uprobes needs a look too...

I'll need to go dig into all that a bit before I have more of an opinion on the
shape of the API.

Thanks,
Mark.
