Dear Friend.
I am sorry for reaching you through this medium as it is the most
convenient way for me to reach you now based on the urgency and its
importance. My name is Barr.Latin Georgina, a legal practitioner
and also the personal legal attorney to (Engr.Dyson) who happens to
be your cousin as been traced to your lineage because of you has the
same last names with him, here in my country, Lome Togo in West
Africa. I want you to assist me in order to transfer a sum of (sum of
US$7.8 Million) into your reliable account as a next of kin. The
board of directors of the bank is planning to confiscate the
consignment fund if i couldn't present the next of kin to his estates
within the next 21 working days. However, it's just my urgent need for
foreign partner that made me contact you for this transaction. Further
details of the transfer will be forwarded to you if you are
interested.

Best Regards.

(Associate Latin Georgina (SAT TV)
