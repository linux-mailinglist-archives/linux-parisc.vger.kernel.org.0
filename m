Yes, correct. I marked this patch as RFC instead of PATCH, as I'm
just trying to find out where it should be headed. I would hope the
other patches can just get merged.

I don't think so, I mainly did it to see if there is a problem with mixing
the two modes, and I couldn't find any. The behavior seems unchanged
before and after my patch, the main difference being a few extra kilobytes
in kernel .text for the generic clockevents code.

Good point, though I would be surprised if anything went wrong with
this patch on real hardware but not in emulation, as all the register-level
interactions with the timer are the same.

Adding oneshot mode is a completely different matter though, that
clearly needs to be tested on real hardware.

Ah, good. This is partly what I had been hoping for, as my patch
can be used as a starting point for that if you want to give it a go.
