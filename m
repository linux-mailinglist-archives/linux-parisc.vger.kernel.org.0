Various architectures handle the hint address differently, but it
appears that the only case across any architecture where an address
above 47 bits will be returned is if the application had a hint address
with a value greater than 47 bits and was using the MAP_FIXED flag.
MAP_FIXED bypasses all other checks so I was assuming that it would be
logical for MAP_FIXED to bypass this as well. If MAP_FIXED is not set,
then the intent is for no hint address to cause a value greater than 47
bits to be returned.

This does have the issue that if MAP_FIXED is used then an address can
be returned above 47-bits, but if an application does not want addresses
above 47-bits then they shouldn't ask for a fixed address above that
range.

Yes riscv is an outlier here. The reason I am pushing for something like
a flag to restrict the address space rather than setting it to be the
default is it seems like if applications are relying on upper bits to be
free, then they should be explicitly asking the kernel to keep them free
rather than assuming them to be free.

In this patch I set the high limit to be the minimum of the provided
high limit and 47 bits so I think that should cover this case?
