Invalidation callbacks need but file operations (e.g ioctl) not.

Looks not, since it can allow to be blocked and lots of driver depends 
on this. (E.g mmu_notifier_range_blockable()).

Nope, current code did this but not the case when map need to be 
invalidated in the vhost control path (ioctl etc).

We will increase invalidate_count which prevent the page being used by map.
