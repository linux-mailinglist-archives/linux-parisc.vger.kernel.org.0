Hi Arnd,

Perhaps patch 13 does not belong in this series (?).

All m68k platforms will need conversion before the TODO can be removed 
from Documentation/features/time/clockevents/arch-support.txt.

On m68k, HZ is fixed at 100. Without addressing that, would there be any 
benefit from adopting GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS as per this RFC patch?

Correct VIA emulation is suprisingly difficult, so this kind of work 
should be tested on real hardware.

I say that because when I did the clocksource conversion for m68k I ran 
into a bug in QEMU (since fixed) and also because I once worked on some of 
the bugs in the emulated VIA device used in MAME/MESS.

I'm not so sure that one timer is able to support both a clocksource 
driver and a clockevent driver. In some cases we may have to drop the 
clocksource driver (i.e. fall back on the jiffies clocksource).

Anyway, even on Macs with only one VIA chip we still have two timers. So I 
think we should try to use Timer 1 as a freerunning clocksource and Timer 
2 as a oneshot clock event. This may result in better accuracy and simpler 
code. This may require some experimentation though.

Writing clockevent drivers is new to me too. I'm still trying to discover 
what the implications might be if the only available clockevent device 
offers oneshot mode or periodic mode but not both.
