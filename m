The number is _not_ interesting in this case. It's useless because the
function does:

    irq = hwirq;

    if (lookup)
        irq = find_mapping(hwirq);

    if (!irq || irq >= nr_irqs)
       -> BAD

So irq is completely useless because find_mapping() returns 0 if there
is no mapping and if irq >= nr_irqs then there was no lookup and the
hwirq number is bogus.

In both cases the only interesting information is that hwirq does not
resolve to a valid Linux interrupt number and which hwirq number caused
that.

generic_handle_irq() _is_ a different function which is only invoked
when there is a valid Linux interrupt number and then the ack_bad_irq()
is invoked from a different place. See below.

If there is no valid linux irq number then there is no lookup. And you
can't look it up from the hardware either.

If you look really then you find out that there is exactly _ONE_
architecture which does anything else than incrementing a counter and/or
printing stuff: X86, which has a big fat comment explaining why. The
only way to ack an interrupt on X86 is to issue EOI on the local APIC,
i.e. it does _not_ need any further information.

There are 3 ways to get there:

      1) via dummy chip which obviously has no hardware associated

      2) via handle_bad_irq() which prints the info already

      3) __handle_domain_irq() which cannot print anything and obviously
         cannot figure out the hw to talk to because there is no irq
         descriptor associated.

This was just for illustration.

Only if there are no irqdomain mappings and the virq space is 1:1 mapped
to the hwirq space. Systems with > 4G interrupts are pretty unlikely.

Also hwirq can be completely artificial and encode information about
interrupts which are composed, i.e. PCI/MSI. See pci_msi_domain_calc_hwirq().

Not all callers print something, but yes this could do with some general
cleanup.

kstat_incr_irqs_this_cpu(desc) operates on the irq descriptor which
requires that an irq descriptor exists in the first place.

The error counter is independent of that, but yes there is room for
consolidation.
