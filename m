ATTENTION DEAR ,

AFTER WE RECEIVED YOUR INFORMATION, WE INSTANTLY TRANSFER THE FIRST 
PAYMENT OF $5000 IN YOUR NAME. AND AS I WAS TRYING TO EMAIL YOU THE 
INFORMATION YOU SHOULD USE TO PICK UP THE PAYMENT IN YOUR COUNTRY, I 
THEN GOT AN ALERT  FROM WESTERN UNION HEAD OFFICE HERE,  THAT THE $5000 
WE TRANSFERRED AND THE REMAINING OF( $10.500`000`00USD ) HAS BEEN ON 
HOLD THROUGH OUR NETWORK BY THE HEAD OFFICE.

I ASKED THEM WHY THEY SAID THAT THE HOMELAND SECURITY COMPANY HERE IN 
UKRAINE REPORTED TO THEM THAT WE ARE TRANSFERRING SUCH AMOUNT OF MONEY 
WITHOUT THE HOMELAND SECURITY CLEARANCE CERTIFICATE. SO, AFTER I CUT OFF 
THE CONVERSATION WITH THE HEAD OFFICE, I CALLED THE HOMELAND SECURITY 
COMPANY TO KNOW HOW THE CLEARANCE COULD BE OBTAINED FROM THEM AND THE 
COST OF OBTAINING IT AND THEY SAID THAT IT WILL COST NOTHING ONLY IF YOU 
DON'T HAVE A WESTERN UNION ACCOUNT.

BELOW IS YOUR MTCN NUMBER YOU CAN TRACK IT WITH THE WEBSITE BELOW OR 
ABOVE.
