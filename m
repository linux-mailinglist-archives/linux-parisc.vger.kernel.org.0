Are they from the kernel side, if the lower bits mean we end up
with the same coloring? Because I think this is a bit of a big
hammer, in terms of overhead for flushing. As an example, on arm64
that is perfectly fine with the existing code, it's about a 20-25%
performance hit.

Other little complaints too in terms of which pages to flush, eg
it's only the first page that is flushed but the ring may be
larger than that. But those are mostly moot if we can just guarantee
the lowest bits fixes the aliasing.
